# Visto: Converts Written Stories into Engaging Visual Experiences 

Visto is a powerful tool developed during a hackathon that transforms written stories into captivating visual experiences. This tool leverages GPT-3 for extracting essential story elements and incorporates custom artwork, background music, and interactive features to create an immersive visual novel game.

## Features

- **Story Conversion:** Visto uses GPT-3 to extract vital story elements, including characters, physical descriptions, dialogues, and scene moods, from PDF or raw text inputs.

- **Custom Artwork Generation:** The tool generates unique artwork for each character and scene background, employing Stable Diffusion AI to capture the distinctive style reminiscent of Studio Ghibli.

- **Immersive Audio Experience:** Visto enhances the storytelling experience by incorporating diverse background music tailored to the mood of each scene. For example, upbeat music accompanies happy scenes, creating a more engaging and emotionally resonant narrative.

- **Interactive Visual Novel Game:** The extracted story data is transformed into a visually stunning and interactive visual novel game using the Ren'Py python library. This allows users to engage with the story in a dynamic and visually appealing format.
